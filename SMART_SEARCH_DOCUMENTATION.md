# Smart Search & RAG-Powered Internship Matching System

## Overview

The Smart Search system is an advanced AI-powered feature that analyzes your resume and intelligently finds the most suitable internship opportunities with calculated acceptance probability scores.

## Key Features

### üß† Intelligent Query Generation
- Analyzes your resume to generate targeted search queries
- Creates searches based on your programming languages, technical skills, and experience level
- Automatically adjusts search terms for your education and career stage

### üìä Compatibility Scoring
The system calculates a comprehensive compatibility score based on three weighted factors:

1. **Technical Skills Match (40% weight)**
   - Required skills alignment
   - Preferred skills bonus
   - Programming language compatibility

2. **Experience Level Match (35% weight)**
   - Entry/Mid/Senior level alignment
   - Years of experience comparison
   - Project portfolio evaluation

3. **Education Match (25% weight)**
   - Degree requirement fulfillment
   - Education level comparison
   - GPA bonus (if applicable)

### üé≤ Acceptance Probability Formula

The acceptance probability is calculated using this proprietary formula:

```
Final Probability = Base Compatibility √ó Competition Factor √ó Timing Factor √ó Profile Completeness

Where:
- Base Compatibility: Your overall compatibility score (0-100%)
- Competition Factor: Estimated competition level (0.8-1.2x)
  - High competition (FAANG, popular roles): 0.8x
  - Medium competition (standard roles): 1.0x  
  - Low competition (startups, niche roles): 1.2x
- Timing Factor: Application timing (0.9-1.15x)
  - Early applications: 1.15x
  - Normal timing: 1.0x
  - Late applications: 0.9x
- Profile Completeness: Resume completeness (0.8-1.0x)
  - Complete profile (all sections): 1.0x
  - Partial profile: 0.8-0.95x
```

### üìà Realistic Constraints Applied
- Maximum probability capped at 85% for realism
- Graduated scaling based on compatibility ranges
- Confidence intervals provided (¬±5% to ¬±25%)

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

### How RAG Works in Smart Search

1. **Context Building**: Your resume serves as the knowledge base
2. **Query Enhancement**: Each search query is enhanced with resume context
3. **Intelligent Filtering**: Results are filtered based on your actual qualifications
4. **Contextual Ranking**: Opportunities ranked by relevance to your background

### Generated Query Types

The system generates up to 5 intelligent queries based on:

1. **Skills-Based Queries**
   - "python developer intern" (if Python is in your skills)
   - "react developer intern" (if React experience exists)

2. **Category-Based Queries**
   - "data science intern" (for data science skills)
   - "cloud engineer intern" (for AWS/Azure experience)

3. **Experience-Level Queries**
   - "entry level software intern" (for beginners)
   - "senior software intern" (for experienced candidates)

4. **Education-Based Queries**
   - "computer science intern" (for CS students)
   - "graduate software intern" (for Master's students)

## Match Categories

### üéØ High Match (80%+ compatibility)
- Strong skills alignment
- Appropriate experience level
- Education requirements met
- High acceptance probability (typically 60-85%)

### üìà Medium Match (60-79% compatibility)
- Good skills overlap
- Minor experience gaps
- Most requirements met
- Moderate acceptance probability (typically 35-60%)

### üìä Low Match (Below 60% compatibility)
- Limited skills alignment
- Significant experience gaps
- Stretch opportunities
- Lower acceptance probability (typically 15-35%)

## Improvement Suggestions Engine

The system provides actionable recommendations:

### Technical Skill Gaps
- "üéØ Learn these required skills: PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes"
- "üìà Consider learning skills in: Data Science, Machine Learning"
